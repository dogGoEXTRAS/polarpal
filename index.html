        <h1>Polar Pal</h1>
        <p>Polar Pal is an artificial intelligence created in December 2, 2023.</p>
        <p>It talks about an event that invariably occurred on December 25 known as Christmas.</p>
        <p>Here are several guides on how to use Polar Pal A.I.</p>
        <h2>Guides: </h2>
        <h3>1. Conversations</h3>
        <p>
            You can talk Polar Pal about greetings, Christmas, activities, and others. If an A.I. does not understand, 
            you can teach Polar Pal how to respond to that particular question. However, if you want to skip it, just simply 
            write skip on the input. 
        </p>

        <h3>2. Activities</h3>
        <p>
            You can do several activities given by Polar Pal. All you have to do is type the number beside the activity. Those 
            numbers typed are legends, and they represent which activity do you want to do. 

            Legend: 
            Type 1 if you want to see a drawing of a Christmas tree
            Type 2 if you want to listen to songs given by Polar Pal. Polar Pal will give you a youtube link to that song. 
            Type 3 if you want to play a cookie game. This game is very simple since you just need to click the cookie. 
            Type 4 if you want to request Santa for presents. All you need to do is type the name of your wishful gift, add it, and request Santa to get your gift acquired. If you have changed your mind, just delete it. 
            Type 5 if you want to quit. It is basically not an activity, but if you want to give up in a conversation, you can quit, and you can always go back to it anytime. 
        </p>

        <h3>How to build knowledge?</h3>
        <p>
            In order to build knowledge, you need to inquire an unknown question to Polar Pal, and teach the A.I. how to respond to that
            unknown question. If you made a mistake on inquiring it, you can simply type "skip" to skip teaching that A.I. Whenever you are finished with that activity, 
            Polar Pal will always inquire you to give me answer, so just type "skip" to skip. 
        </p>
